Aadhaar Enrolment, Demographic & Biometric Update Analysis

Overview
This project analyzes Aadhaar enrolment, demographic update, and biometric update datasets published by UIDAI to understand state-wise Aadhaar usage patterns and system maturity across India.

Objective
To evaluate whether Aadhaar activity in different states is driven by new enrolments or maintenance through demographic and biometric updates, using derived indicators such as the Update-to-Enrolment Ratio.

Datasets Used
Aadhaar Enrolment Dataset (age-wise aggregated enrolments)
Aadhaar Demographic Update Dataset (name, address, DOB, gender, mobile updates)
Aadhaar Biometric Update Dataset (fingerprint, iris, and face updates)
Source: UIDAI Open Government Data Platform (Data as of December 2025)

Methodology
Data cleaning and preprocessing using Python (Pandas)
State-wise aggregation of enrolment, demographic, and biometric updates
Calculation of total enrolments and total updates
Derivation of Update-to-Enrolment and Biometric Update Ratios
Visualization of Aadhaar usage intensity across states

Key Insights
Higher update ratios indicate mature Aadhaar ecosystems focused on data maintenance
Biometric updates are significantly higher in states with large adult populations, reflecting periodic revalidation needs

Tools & Technologies
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook

Output
Cleaned and aggregated CSV files
Visual insights and state-wise comparisons
Reproducible analysis for governance and policy planning
